    <img src="images/evo.jpg" alt="evolution" id="evo"><br><br><br>
    <p> Since the first humans set foot on the planet, we have had a dependent relation on nature. Nature provides us with everything that is necessary
      to us in order to survive and to entertain ourselves if we find a way. Before the invention of cultivation nature would easily replenish itselves and 
      humans would have the same resources from the same branch of nature after some time. During this time, humanity didn't destroy nature but harness its most basic 
      resources. As humans invented cultivation we were able to utilise more resources of nature in return for a longer time for nature to replenish its sources. Slowly and steadily
     humanity grew and started harvesting and using more of nature's resources, making nature not being able to keep up with humanity's demand. Soon humanity's actions to make their lives easier and use more resources by nature
    started hurting the environment altogether, thus starting this war of 'Human vs Nature'.</p><br>
    <p>At this point, environment problems are at their peak. Problems range from area-specific such as pollution to global problems such as global warming. Rather than considering these environmental problems as effects of humanity's
       actions, we can also see them as environment's answer back. Many people have tried to help and lessen down this sour relationship between humanity and nature by taking actions such as afforestation to replenish trees, using green energy to 
      stop the decrease of non-renewable energy and many more. But the problems that we are facing right now aren't limited to the efforts of a single person, in order to make ammends in this relationship all of humans need to act as one single community
    since all humans are facing the repurcussions of our actions.</p>
