    <h1 id="im"> Theory of Impact Events</h1><br><br><br>
    <img src="./images/aster.jpg" alt="Dinosaur asteroid" id="aster"><br><br><br>
    <p> Overpopulation has always been an important problem for human beings over the years. Population rose from 2.5 billion in 1950s to 
      the current near 8 billion. Earth has not been very favourable to this change and this can be seen by how the number of problems regarding the environment is the highest
      that there has been; extinction of species, endangerment of species, global warming, food scarcity are just the tip of the iceberg of all the present problems.<p><br>
    <p> The theory that this page explores isn't validated by any scientific evidence yet, but the pattern it shows makes it a conspiracy. Its supported by many 
      scientists around the world as a punishment to the overpopulation of the Earth done by humanity. The theory of 'Impact Events' states that every 50 million years or so, nature
    creates an extinction level event to control the population of the Earth. This extinction level event wipes out millions of creatures giving nature time to replenish its sources. Some of the 
    examples of this include the extinction of dinosaurs during the Cretaceous period that happened 66 million years ago and is the latest one, the Ordivician Extinction that happened 445 million years ago, the Devonian Extinction (375 million years ago), Permian Extinction (252 million years ago) etc. 
    According to the theory if its not just a pattern of extinctions in history, Humanity is already due of a major extinction level event to happen. Some supporters of this theory say
    that the overdue is because of the size of the extinction and the one that will happen, if it happens will be very big. </p> <br>
    <p> It is possible to eliminate the possibility of this happening completely if humanity takes a radical solution in the very near future to preserve nature, question how its exploiting it and make reforms to fix its mistakes.
