    <p>To defend itself from human actions, nature attacks against humanity which we call environmental problems. These attacks have 
      injured and killed a lot of people in history, for which not nature but humanity is reponsible. One example of this includes, global warming
    which is occuring because of the increase in heat trapping gasses in the environment emitted mainly by cars and factories. These heat trapping gasses such as Carbon Dioxide and Nitrogen Dioxide etc, 
    warm the environment up, melting glaciers and causing increase in temperature. Melting glaciers can cause floods and water scarcity in the future while increase in temperature increases the chance of heat strokes and 
  other heat related problems. Around 200,000 people die annually due to global warming.</p><br>
  <p>Another of these effects include human induced natural disasters such as acid rain, which is a direct result of increase in gasses such as sulfuric acid in the air. These gasses then mix with water vapor to form acid and then
    rain down on human beings having extreme injury inducing and fatal results; soil degradation, which is a result of too much cultivation on a piece of land making the land lose its fertility making unhealthy
    crops and crops with problems which may cause diseases in human beings. The surprising part is that every environmental problem can be solved using just one word which is resource conservation. Conserving what nature has given 
    to us is the only way environmental problems can be eliminated. Although the problems are on such a scale that the conservation will require perseverance and time. But its time well spent since its towards the welfare of humanity.
